$ npm install topview-init -g
```

```

If you notice **All set! projects are awesome, have fun! :)**, that means our project's structure is already generated, cheers!

## Usage

We almost there...

```bash
$ npm install && npm run dev
```

Hit ~~localhost:8080~~ [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and create our awesome project right now!

Every time you save the files in the `src` folder will reload the browser, so you don't need to press <kbd>F5</kbd> repeatedly.

## Build

```bash
$ npm run build
```

with this command, we will

1. Bundle all modules into a `bundle.js` and all stylesheets into a `bundle.css` in `dist` folder with webpack.
2. Uglity `.js`, minify `.html` and `.css` into `build` folder with gulp.

## Attention

This boilerplate is never used in large applications or projects, so it probably has lots of problems. but that's ok, I believe you guys will constantly improve it.
